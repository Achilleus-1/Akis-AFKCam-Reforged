# Aki's AFK Cam Reforged branding

Artwork by Achilleus. The supplied cover is the identity for this mod.

| Asset | Use |
| --- | --- |
| [Original cover](docs/cover.png) | Unmodified 1024 x 1024 PNG with original transparency |
| [README cover](docs/cover-preview.png) | 1024 x 1024 PNG on white for readable artwork in both light and dark themes |
| [Mod icon](src/main/resources/icon.png) | 512 x 512 PNG for the NeoForge Mods screen, Modrinth, CurseForge, and launcher listings |
| [Resource-pack icon](src/main/resources/pack.png) | Matching 512 x 512 icon packaged in the mod JAR |
| [Social preview](docs/social-preview.png) | 1280 x 640 PNG for GitHub repository Settings > General > Social preview |

`META-INF/neoforge.mods.toml` selects `icon.png`. Gradle includes both packaged icons in every build. Bundled resource packs, where present, use the same mod artwork.

The display exports preserve the full composition and use a white background so the dark lettering stays readable. The original transparent cover remains available unchanged. The social preview centers the artwork on white. Use the same mod icon for external project avatars and the cover for promotional artwork. GitHub's social preview must be uploaded separately in repository settings.
